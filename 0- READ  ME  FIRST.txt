
Hello, I am Aminur Refat Faisal. Thanks for using my project. I hope you are using to learn something.
Please don't copy this project. Try to make it yourself. You'll get the real pleasure then.

Make sure that you are not skipping any of the following steps. Good Luck.


----------------------------------------- W E L C O M E --------------------------------------------


1) At first open " NECESSARY FILES TO RUN THIS PROJECT " this folder.

2) Import the library files in your IDE. (Netbeans, IntelliJ Idea, VsCode, Eclipse etc.)

3) Download & Install " MySQL Workspace ". 
   
   - Set the password of MYSQL - " javaproject ".
   - Then Copy & Paste those files properly.
   - In mysql, select first lines and click the " Thunder ICON " at the left top edge of MySQL.
   - Like this, select each line individully and click the ICON.

4) That's it. Now you can Run the GUI Application from your IDE without any errors.

5) All of the .java files are in " src " folder.
